Eliminate Internal Negative Chatter
　　The first step is one of awareness. It will be hard to make a change to positive thinking without being acutely intimate with the thoughts that run through your mind. Recently, I was amazed to discover deep buried emotions from negative thoughts that I had for fewer than 10 minutes. Without awareness, I would have carried the hurt and anger inside. Awareness helped me to bring them out to the open for me to deal with.
　　Undoubtedly it will not be easy to make a switch if you have a long history or negative self talk. Your talk became negative over the years due to various factors. For instance, if your first grade teacher repeatedly told you that you were "stupid", you might believe it to be truly the case. You would find that your inner chatter would often be filled with talk of "I am so slow" and "it is so hard to learn". If you constantly tell yourself such negative stories, your actions are going to reflect your low self esteem. It will be difficult to get very far if you are always putting yourself down.
　　A common negative talk involves telling yourself "I can’t". When you say to yourself "I can’t" or "it is too difficult", you are creating a resistance. Having such a mental block will prevent you from achieving a task you could otherwise succeed at.
　　Anytime you catch yourself saying "I can’t…", turn around and challenge your own claim with, "Why can’t I?" Research shows that most geniuses became the people they are also because of the hard work they put in. So if you would like to be successful, you need to start saying "I can" a lot more.
　　A great method that I have also found useful is to say "Cancel Cancel" each time I find myself saying something negative, whether in the mind or verbally. The method works if you sincerely have the intent of becoming a positive thinker.
